you can deploy your Flask-based ML model on Vercel. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Prepare your project: Make sure your Flask application is ready.

2. Create a vercel.json file: This file is responsible for configuring Vercel in your application. You need to create a vercel.json file in the root of your directory and add the following code to the file1:

JSON
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.

{
"version": 2,
"builds": [
{
"src": "index.py",
"use": "@vercel/python"
}
],
"routes": [
{
"src": "/(.*)",
"dest": "index.py"
}
]
}
This configuration file tells Vercel how to build and serve the Flask application. The src field in the builds array should point to the entry point of your application.

3. Push your project to GitHub: If you haven’t already, push your project to a repository on GitHub.

4. Deploy on Vercel: Log in to your Vercel account and import the project from GitHub. Vercel will automatically detect the vercel.json file and build your project accordingly.

Remember to replace 'index.py' with the path to the entry point of your application inside the src directory. If the entry point is not index.py, you’ll need to provide the correct filename.
